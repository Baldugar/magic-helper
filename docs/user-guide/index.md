## Key Concepts

### Zones
Zones are containers for your cards, like piles on a physical table. Create zones for "Creatures", "Lands", "Sideboard", or any category that makes sense for your deck building process.

### Visual Copies (Phantoms)
Create visual copies of cards to see them in multiple zones simultaneously. The deck still only contains one copy - these are just visual aids.

### Ternary Filters
Unlike simple on/off filters, Magic Helper uses ternary filters with three states:
- **Include** (green) - Show cards matching this criterion
- **Exclude** (red) - Hide cards matching this criterion
- **Neutral** (gray) - Don't filter on this criterion

### Tag Chains
Organize tags hierarchically. For example: `Strategy > Aggro > Creature-based`. Filter by any level of the chain.
